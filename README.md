# 🌱 Your First Contribution

Helping absolute beginners make (and understand) their very first open‑source contribution—step by step, safely, and kindly.

## Why this exists

Many newcomers want to contribute but get stuck on: forks, branches, commits, pull requests, reviews, etiquette, or even “what can I change without breaking things?”. This repository is a deliberately simple playground where you can learn the workflow with tiny, confidence‑building tasks.

## What you will learn here

By completing one small task you will practice:

- Forking a repo
- Cloning locally
- Creating a branch
- Making a meaningful, minimal change
- Writing a good commit message
- Opening a Pull Request (PR)
- Responding to review feedback

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Click Fork (top right) to copy this repo to your account.
3. Clone your fork to your computer:
   - Example (HTTPS): `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/your-first-contribution-.git`
4. Enter the folder: `cd your-first-contribution-`
5. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-your-name`
6. Pick one starter task from `tasks/README.md` (e.g. add yourself to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`).
7. Make the edit, then stage & commit:
   - `git add CONTRIBUTORS.md`
   - `git commit -m "docs: add <your-name> to contributors"`
8. Push your branch: `git push -u origin add-your-name`
9. Open a Pull Request (GitHub will show a prompt). Fill in the PR template and submit.
10. Wait for review, apply any feedback, get merged. 🎉

## Starter Tasks

Go to `tasks/README.md` for a curated list of “good first” micro‑tasks (all safe). Finish one before you try bigger things elsewhere.

## Project Structure

```
README.md                – You are here
CONTRIBUTING.md          – Detailed contribution guide (read after this)
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md       – Expected behavior & reporting
CONTRIBUTORS.md          – People who completed a starter task
tasks/README.md          – List of beginner-friendly tasks
.github/                 – Issue & PR templates
```

## Contribution Flow (Visual)

```
Fork → Clone → Branch → Change → Commit → Push → Pull Request → Review → Merge
```

## Commit Message Style

Use a short type + short description:

```
docs: add Jane Doe to contributors
chore: fix typo in README quick start
```

Types you can use here: `docs`, `chore`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`.

## Need Help?

If you’re unsure, open a draft Pull Request early and ask a question inside it, or open an issue using the “Question” template. Learning out loud is encouraged.

## Code of Conduct

We enforce a friendly, inclusive environment. See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for expectations and reporting steps.

## FAQ (mini)

**Q: I’m scared to break something.** The tasks are designed so you really can’t. Worst case: we ask for a small tweak.

**Q: My PR failed a check.** Read the message, push another commit fixing it. That’s normal.

**Q: Can I try more than one task?** Yes—just keep each task on its own branch & PR.

## After Your First Contribution

Level up by:

- Improving wording / docs clarity
- Creating a new beginner task (open an issue first)
- Helping review a later newcomer’s PR (kindly!)

## License

Assumed MIT for now (see `LICENSE`). If maintainers choose a different license later, this section will update.
